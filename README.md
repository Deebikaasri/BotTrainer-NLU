# 🤖 BotTrainer – LLM-Based NLU Model Trainer & Evaluator

BotTrainer is a modern Natural Language Understanding (NLU) framework built using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify user intents and extract entities through prompt engineering, rather than relying on conventional machine-learning classifiers.

The system is designed around a JSON-centric dataset, runs locally using the Gemma-3 model via Ollama, and offers live predictions, evaluation metrics, and dataset insights through an intuitive Streamlit interface.

🚀 Core Features

🔹 Intent recognition powered by LLM reasoning

🔹 JSON-based intent and entity definitions

🔹 Prompt-driven structured responses

🔹 Fully local inference using Gemma-3

🔹 Built-in evaluation with performance metrics

🔹 Modular, scalable project organization

🔹 Interactive dashboard for testing and analysis
